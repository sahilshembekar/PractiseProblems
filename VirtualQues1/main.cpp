/*
Virtual Keyword was added

The virtual keyword basically tells the method that, 
there may be other methods in other classes that uses the same name! So use that one instead.
So in this case, you see how both classes have a method which has the same name? int get_price().
If we don't add the virtual keyword, then HotelRoom's int get_price() will always get called as 
it is the parent class.
The virtual keyword tells the compiler to see if HotelApartment, which is a child of HotelRoom, 
has int get_price(), and if it does, use that one instead!
